# Smart Selective Antennas System (SSAS 1.0)

Authors [Emanuele Pagliari](https://github.com/Palia95)

The code in this repository refers to the first implementation of Smart Selective Antennas System (SSAS), aiming at mitigating inter-cell interference effects of cellular networks for in-flight Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The code of the antenna control algorithms (NBTS and CBTS) is available, as well as some of the gathered data during the experimental evaluations.
